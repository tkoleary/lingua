## The web has changed, multilingual should too

The web was designed to be device-independent but for language we still rely heavily on device fonts and settings. It's time we aknowledged that users who speak non-latin languages want a web that works everytwhere, not just on their own machine or their own locale. Webfonts have been here for more than a decade and are central to the design of the web. Now that we have open-source fonts covering virtually all of Unicode there should be an easy way to have our sites do the same. That's why Lingua was created.

### We believe:

1. The variety of languages and scripts is part of the richness of human culture and should be fostered
2. The web should be usable, and beautiful, in any language and script on any browser and device
3. Designers and developers can make this happen, but only if we make it easier to achieve
