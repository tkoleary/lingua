## The web has changed, internationalization hasn't

The web is universal and device-independent, but for internationalization, not so much. We need to recognize that users who speak languages with non-latin scripts often need to browse the web on a device other than their own, multilingual users to see content in different languages, sometimes on the same page, and no user wants to suffer poor UX and broken design because of their language.

Even though Webfonts have been with us for more than a decade and have become central to the design of the web, design for 118n is a backwater. Outside the comfort-zone of latin script, we throw up our hands and leave it to device settings, fonts, and user preferences. It's understandable, webfonts can be hard even within latin, but they shouldn't be. That's why Lingua was created.

### We believe:

1. Websites and apps should be usable in any language and script on any browser and device
2. Web designers should be empowered to produce sites that are beautiful in any language
3. Engineers should have a painles path to making those designs a reality
4. Type designers should be empowered to deliver more universal fonts for the web
